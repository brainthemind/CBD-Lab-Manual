**Team **

Joining a research team means contributing your critical thinking, your skills, and your diligence to the team, and the team helping you sharpen your thinking, acquire new skills and techniques and advance your work much further than you could have done on your own.

Every lab member plays a vital role in the functioning from undergraduate students to early career researchers, support staff, and principal investigators (PIs)!

Providing you with rules and procedures is to ensure that current efforts reset on past success and failures and pushes as
far as possible in better directions. Novel arrivals should need to re-invent anything, you should not be starting
your experiments from scratch, but build on what previous  researchers have already built.
