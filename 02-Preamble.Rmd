# Preamble

    The Brain - is wider than the Sky -
    For - put them side by side -
    The one the other will contain
    With ease - and You - beside -
    -Emily Dickinson

    The human brain has 100 billion neurons, each neuron 
    connect to ten thousands other neurons. 
    Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object 
    in the known universe.
    -Michio Kaku

Cognitive neuroscientists have the privilege to study the most complex organ nature has came up with. The hardship in understanding the brain may be as great as its complexity!


**Scientific vision**

To gain deeper mechanistic insights on how the human mind conceives time the way it does. The dynamic scales at which neural computations operate can be conceived as a chronoarchitecture. The notion of chronoarchitecture emphasizes that dynamic properties of neural activity do not solely reflect adaptive changes but also constraints that provide stability for a thinking mind to emerge.

Our theoretical and empirical approach considers both endogenous (oscillatory regimes, prediction, culture) and exogenous (temporal statistics of sensory inputs, body movements) factors to be essential for temporal cognition. 

Our scientific work uses tools from traditional experimental psychology (psychophysics, questionnaires) combined with state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques (MEG, EEG, fMRI), signal processing methods (spectral and time-frequency analyses, source estimation, cross-frequency coupling, functional connectivity) and model-based neuroimaging (mTRF, decoding). 

We try to foster collaborative opportunities that can be fundamental, multidisciplinary or applied.


**Core Values**

    We are not thinking machines that feel; 
    rather, we are feeling machines that think
    -Antonio Damasio**

Collegiality: the lab should be a give-give place in which we all learn from one another. Science is hard enough, foster being constructive and collaborative, not destructive and competitive.

Integrity: everyone must follow strict institutional, scientific, and ethical guidelines. No exception.

Excellence: we  strive for the highest quality of scientific research.

Creativity: 

Perseverance: 

Finish!
