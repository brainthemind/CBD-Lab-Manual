# Getting Started

**Who we are**

Our official affiliation is: 
Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit, CEA, INSERM, Université Paris-Saclay, NeuroSpin center, 91191 Gif/Yvette, France

What it means: 
The Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit [UNICOG](http://www.unicog.org/) is a research unit, which  is part of two major institutions: the "Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale" ([INSERM](https://www.inserm.fr/) for short) and the "Comissariat à l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives" ([CEA](http://www.cea.fr/) for short). 
UNICOG is hosted by [NeuroSpin](http://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx), which refers to the physical building located at Gif s/ Yvette where our lab is. UNICOG is also affiliated to the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

The director of NeuroSpin and of UNICOG is Prof Stanislas Dehaene (College de France). 

The [Cognition & Brain Dynamics](https://brainthemind.com/) lab is one of the five labs within UNICOG. 

For general administrative guidance and human resources help, please be in touch with [Vanna Santoro](giovanna.santoro@cea.fr). 

The contact information of everyone at NeuroSpin can be found [here](http://www.neurospin-wiki.org/pmwiki/Main/PhoneNumbers)

**Resources**

NeuroSpin is a neuroimaging center with great tools on site, and lots of technical and methodological knowledge available. NeuroSpin has a [wiki](http://www.neurospin-wiki.org/pmwiki/) where you can find a lot of practical information.**Please check it often as it can answer many  questions you may have from how to pay for a conference to who is in charge of the IT, how to use trigger with MEG or how to analyze DTI. Also, please update information if it is outdated to keep it alive!**

Cognition & Brain Dyanmics has a website [http://brainthemind.com/] in which we would like each member to be listed and briefly introduced. Please, send us a short snippet describing your interests and prior work, plus a picture (square format with good resolution) so we can add you.

Every member of the team presents their project at different stages. We also do journal clubs and round tables to which everyone contributes by preparing a slide. Take the team meeting as an opportunity to ask questions, express doubts,  learn from feedback and interact on deep questions to prepare you for presenting your work to the outside world.
